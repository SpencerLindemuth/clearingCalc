###Clearing Calculator

Create a function called clearingCalc that calculates a fee based on how much area of land was cleared
on the site prior to building a structure. The function must take only one input parameter of squareFeet
and the function must return the correct fee. Use the table below to create your function.

Cleared Area Fee
1 Acre or Less $135
1 – 2 Acres $203
2 – 5 Acres $270
5 – 10 Acres $270 + $34 for each Acre above 5
10+ Acres $439 + $27 for each Acre above 10

Example 1
Input: 150
Output: 135.00
Example 2
Input: 130681
Output: 270.00
